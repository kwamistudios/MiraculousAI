# MiraculousAI

The AI used by Troy High School to compete in the final round of Colorfight! Season 4. Created by Kwami Studio's design lead.

## Hive Mind

* Master Fu assigns the Kwamis (Tikki, Plagg, and Trixx) to the holders (Marinette, Adrien, and Alya), initializing the Miraculous objects

* Each Miraculous holder then transforms with help from their Kwami, joining the Colorfight server

* Master Fu refreshes the game state, sharing the data by letting Wayzz contact the Kwamis of the Miraculous holders

## Strategy

* Each Miraculous holder will pursue gold cells until all other holders have a cell each

* Find a midpoint between the three Miraculous holders and establish the Eiffel tower

* Eiffel Tower: Pursue the midpoint and build bases in the centralized location

* Use a random expansion algorithm to expand around the Eiffel tower and defend it

* Determine which Miraculous holder has the best fitness, then work to get them ahead
